# Auto State Documentation

Welcome to the Auto State documentation.

Auto State is a rule based extension for updating parent states when a work item updated.

- [RULES](./RULES.md)
- [SETTINGS](./SETTINGS.md)

## Rules

For details on how to configure rules, see [RULES](./RULES.md);

## Testing Rules

The Rule Tester allows you to perform a dry run of rules to see how it will update work items.

You can find the rule tester in two places:

1. From the admin page. Here you can test rules for all work items.

2. From the individual work item. Here you can test rules for the current work item.

   ![rule-tester-work-item](./images/rule-tester-work-item.png)

The rule tester will show all work items that will be changed.
